# Machine Learning Project with MLflow

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of MLflow for managing a simple machine learning project. The main objective is to create a machine learning model and utilize MLflow for tracking experiments, managing the machine learning lifecycle, and documenting model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MLflow
- Scikit-learn (or any other ML library you used)
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation

Describe the steps to install MLflow and any other necessary libraries. For example:
pip install mlflow
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

## Running the Project

Instructions on how to run the project. For example:
mlflow run .


## MLflow Tracking

Explain how to track experiments with MLflow. Include details about:

- Starting the MLflow tracking UI.
- Viewing the experiment results.

For example:

To view the experiment tracking interface:
mlflow ui


Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to see the MLflow Tracking UI.

## Model Functionality

Briefly describe the machine learning model used in the project, including its main features and how it was trained and evaluated.
